                    any and all information that is necessary to determine the needs of the employee applying to the
                    AutoZoner Assistance Fund Administrators and/or its representatives. I understand that my records
                    are protected under Federal and State confidentiality regulations and cannot be disclosed without my
                    written consent unless otherwise provided for in the regulations. I also understand that I may

                    reliance on it. I also acknowledge that the information released was fully explained to me and this
                    consent is given of my own free will. A photocopy of this authorization is valid as the
