Use docker and docker-compose to get up-and-running quick. Make sure that you have the latest version of docker-compose (install via `pip install docker-compose`). Start the web/app/mongo server by doing `docker-compose up` and check your localhost:80. Any time you change the API, you have to stop running the containers, do a`docker-compose build`, and then re-run `docker-compose up`.
