# Quickstart

```
pip install docker-compose && npm install
docker-compose up
```
Then, open http://localhost:80. Your changes to Angular will take effect once you reload your browser.

If you make changes to the backend services, you'll need to rebuild the api container; do that with `docker-compose build`.
